OVERVIEW OF TEMPERATURE CONVERTOR
I can provide you with an overview of how to create a temperature converter program in C++. This program will convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Here's a basic outline of how you can implement this:

### Steps to create a Temperature Converter in C++

1. **Include Necessary Libraries:**
   Start by including the necessary standard libraries for input and output operations (`iostream`) and for mathematical operations (`cmath`).

  
2. **Define Functions:**
   Define functions to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

  
3. **Main Function:**
   Implement the main function where the user interacts with the program.

   
### Explanation:

- **Functions:** Each conversion function takes a temperature value in one scale and returns its equivalent in another scale using the appropriate conversion formula.
  
- **Main Function:** 
  - Displays a menu for the user to choose the type of conversion.
  - Reads the user's choice and the temperature input.
  - Calls the corresponding conversion function based on the user's choice and prints the converted temperature.

### Example Usage:

If the user chooses option 1 (Celsius to Fahrenheit) and enters 25 as the temperature, the program will output:
```
25 Celsius = 77 Fahrenheit
```
